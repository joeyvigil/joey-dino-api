In a hypothetical matchup between a Triceratops and a Stegosaurus, the Triceratops would likely hold the advantage in a fight, largely due to its superior offensive capabilities and higher weight. Weighing up to 10–12 tons, a mature Triceratops was a heavily armored tank designed to charge head-first, using its three razor-sharp, meter-long brow horns and massive beak to gore and pierce opponents. While the Stegosaurus was also a formidable opponent, roughly 30 feet in length and equipped with a dangerous four-spiked tail (the "thagomizer"), its weapon required it to pivot to attack, leaving its head and sides vulnerable to a direct charging attack from the Triceratops. 
However, the outcome is not entirely one-sided, as a Stegosaurus could still inflict severe damage. If the Stegosaurus managed to land a hit with its tail spikes—which paleontological evidence suggests were capable of causing serious harm to predators—it could cripple the Triceratops. Despite this, the Triceratops's ability to withstand high-impact combat, combined with its greater speed and aggressive nature, makes it the more probable victor in a "mortal combat" scenario.
